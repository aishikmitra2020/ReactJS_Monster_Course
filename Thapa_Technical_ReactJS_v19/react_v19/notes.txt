React converts JSX into React elements.
        JSX (JavaScript XML) is not directly used in the browser. It is transpiled into React elements using React.createElement().

React uses the Virtual DOM (VDOM) for efficient updates.
        React maintains a Virtual DOM, which is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM.

        When the state or props change, React creates a new Virtual DOM tree.

React performs "Diffing" (Reconciliation).
        React compares (diffs) the new Virtual DOM with the previous Virtual DOM.

        It calculates the minimum required updates instead of re-rendering everything.

React updates the real DOM efficiently.
        After finding differences, React updates only the necessary parts of the real DOM using batch updates (via React Fiber).


Babel
Babel's role is to convert JSX into JavaScript code. However, React itself is responsible for creating React Elements from that code.

1️⃣ You write JSX in a React component:
const App = () => {
  return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
};

2️⃣ Babel compiles JSX into React.createElement():
Babel converts the JSX code into the following JavaScript:
const App = () => {
  return React.createElement("h1", null, "Hello, World!");
};

3️⃣ React.createElement() creates a React Element:
{
  type: "h1",
  props: { children: "Hello, World!" },
  key: null,
}

4️⃣ React renders this element inside the Virtual DOM and updates the real DOM.



1.      JSX is not valid JavaScript, so it needs to be converted into JavaScript.
2.      Babel (a compiler) transpiles JSX into React.createElement() calls.
3.      React.createElement() generates React elements, which are plain JavaScript objects.
4.      These React elements form the Virtual DOM, which React uses to efficiently update the real DOM.
