let x = 0;
const upddateX = () => {
    x++;
    console.log(x);
    
}
its printing the right value in console but not showing the right value in the UI

Why is x Updating in Console but Not in UI?
In your code, x is a normal variable, not a state variable. This means:
‚úÖ It updates in the console (inside the function call).
‚ùå It does not trigger a re-render, so the UI does not update.

üî¥ Problem:
x updates, but React does not track normal variables between renders.
The UI only updates when React state changes, which is not happening here.
