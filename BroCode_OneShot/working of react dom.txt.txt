1. React Uses a One-Way Data Flow
React follows a unidirectional data flow, meaning:

The component state (useState) determines the value of the input field.

When the state or props changes, React re-renders the component and updates the UI accordingly.

If there is no onChange handler, the state does not update when the user types, so the UI remains the same.


2. React Does Not Modify the DOM Directly
React does not directly update the DOM like traditional JavaScript (document.getElementById). Instead, it:

Maintains a Virtual DOM (a copy of the actual DOM).

Compares the Virtual DOM with the previous version (Diffing).

Updates only the parts that have changed.


only change in state initiates a re-render but without using onChanfge with useState hook it doesn't change the state and it doesn't initiate a re-render to update the value in its dom
Key Points:
React does not modify the DOM directly. It updates the Virtual DOM first and then syncs changes to the actual DOM.

State (useState) controls the UI. When state changes, React triggers a re-render and updates the UI accordingly.

Without onChange, state never updates. Since React controls the value of the input via state, the input field remains unchanged if the state does not change.

No state change = No re-render = No UI update.


What is the Virtual DOM in React?
The Virtual DOM (VDOM) is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM (Document Object Model) that React uses to efficiently update the UI.

Instead of updating the real DOM directly (which is slow), React first updates the Virtual DOM, compares it with the previous version (diffing), and applies only the necessary changes to the real DOM (reconciliation).



How Does the Virtual DOM Work?
Render Phase:

When state or props change, React creates a new Virtual DOM tree.

Diffing Phase (Comparing Old & New Virtual DOM):

React compares the new Virtual DOM with the previous one to find what changed.

Reconciliation Phase (Updating the Real DOM Efficiently):

React updates only the changed parts of the real DOM instead of re-rendering everything.

Why Does React Use a Virtual DOM?
âœ” Faster Updates: Directly modifying the real DOM is slow. The Virtual DOM minimizes these updates.
âœ” Efficient Rendering: React only updates changed elements, not the entire page.
âœ” Better Performance: Reduces expensive DOM operations, improving app speed


ðŸ“Œ When Does a Component Re-Render in React?
A React component re-renders when:

State changes (useState, useReducer).

Props change (received from parent components).

Context value updates (useContext).

A parent component re-renders (causing its children to re-render).

A forceful re-render is triggered (useEffect, forceUpdate()).
